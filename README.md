# OVERVIEW
The Maize-Maze initiative aimed to create an innovative and immersive game experience, departing from traditional app development. The project's name, Maize-Maze, cleverly reflects the conceptâ€”a 3D maze runner horror game set in a haunted corn maze. Initially conceptualized as a 2D top-down maze, the project evolved into a 3D format to enhance realism and engagement, aligning with industry standards.

In Maize-Maze, players navigate through a sinister corn maze, evading malevolent entities. The game challenges players to escape the maze's confines or succumb to the lurking horrors.

## Experience Gained

Throughout the development process, the team gained substantial experience in several key technologies and tools, including:

- C#
- Unity 3D
- Blender
- Git
- Visual Studio

##Key Features

**Diverse AI:** The game includes three distinct AI adversaries, each equipped with unique pathfinding scripts that contribute to a dynamic and engaging player experience. Future updates may introduce additional AI characters.

**Sound FX:** Atmospheric sounds and a haunting musical theme set the eerie tone of the game, with special audio cues, such as terrifying screeches, triggered upon the player's capture.

**Animations:** All characters are fully animated with varying animations based on their state; characters switch from walking to running animations upon detecting the player, enhancing the game's realism.

**Scripted Events:** The game enriches the narrative through triggered animations and events as the player navigates through designated trigger zones, creating a deeper level of immersion.

**Dialogue:** Story progression is facilitated through dialogue boxes that elaborate the storyline and guide the player through the game's plot.
